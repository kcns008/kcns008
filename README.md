### Hi there 👋

Building, troubleshooting, and managing Openshift / Kubernetes clusters sometime with GPUs.

I'm currently building:
- [**cluster-code**](https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-code) - AI agent for K8s / OCP cluster management.
- [**llm-on-k8s**](https://github.com/kcns008/llm-on-k8s) - Production-grade LLM deployment on Kubernetes.

I would be more than happy to contribute and help companies host their own inference services, as I strongly believe this is crucial for product and service survival.
